# Message Extension Attack

This is my first go at Python, and I'm a believer now!

### Running
There's no need for compiling, just run the Python 3 script with the following command:
```
./Msg-Extension-Attack.py
```
This program is able to carry out an extension attack with a given message and message authentication code (MAC / HMAC) generated by the SHA-1 algorithm. This script is only able to successfully do this with algorithms that compute the MAC by hashing a 128-bit secret key with the message being transmitted. Once executed, the script will prompt you for the intercepted message, MAC, and what you want to add to the message. Then it will automatically generate the new message (in hex) and MAC.
