# Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange

There's no need for compiling, just run the Python 3 script with the following command:
```
./Diffie-Hellman.py
```
This program generates a random safe 1024-bit prime number, calculates a private and public key, and then asks for a server's public key, IV, and ciphertext to decrypt using the calculated 128-bit symmetric key digest.
