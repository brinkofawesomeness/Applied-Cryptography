# RSA

There's no need for compiling, just run the Python 3 script with the following command:
```
./RSA.py
```
This RSA program generates two random safe 512-bit prime numbers, calculates the private key using the extended Euclidean algorithm, and then it uses it to encrypt and decrypt values from user input.
