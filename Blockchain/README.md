# Blockchain

This script stores quotes into a blockchain named Quotechain. Once executed, the script will ask for a hash of the initial block and a quote before calculating and printing out a nonce and a hash of the new block appened to the chain. It will prompt the user for a new quote over and over until the user types "Done".

There's no need for compiling, just run the Python 3 script with the following command:
```
./Blockchain.py
```
