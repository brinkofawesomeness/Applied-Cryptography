# Transport Layer Security (TLS)

The purpose of this project is to closely examine how different websites establish secure connections through various cipher suites and protocols. To accomplish this, data was collected from ten personally frequented websites using the `openssl s_client` command line interface (CLI) and arranged in a table for comparison.

In general, there were more similarities than differences between all of the cipher suites, but there were still a few interesting finds, which left a couple lingering questions.
